              Hi. I'm Paul. Thanks for stopping by. Please take a look around
            </p>

              I am currently attending UCONN coding bootcamp to become a full
              stack developer. Prior I graduated from central Connecticut state
              university in a degree in finance and worked in tax; however,
              coding is where I believe I found my passion. It requires an
              endless journey of learning and persistence which I value highly.
